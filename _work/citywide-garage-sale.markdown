  body: This abridged media consultancy plan was created as a TexasMedia project in
    the fall of 2017 for City-Wide Garage Sale, a forty-year- old vintage market in
    Austin, TX. My six-person group evaluated the client’s existing communication
    efforts and proposed owned media, search &amp; display, social media, terrestrial,
    and eCommerce recommendations.

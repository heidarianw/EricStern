    <h6>executive summary</h6>
    <p>the proposal is for the design and development of a portfolio website for eric stern. the focus will be clean, minimal design, developed with the ability to create content within the siteleaf content management system that will be flexible, and can adapt to allow for multiple presentations based on the project’s type i.e. different layouts for video vs. garment design.</p>

    <h6>design • $1750</h6>
    <p>in the design process, we create the layouts for each page, incorporating many elements including the needs of each page, the requirements for displaying different project types, inspiration from other portfolio sites in similar sectors etc. and we build. we’ll be able to work closely together to create exactly what you need to make a clean, scaleable site that can grow with your company.</p>

    <h6>development • $500</h6>
    <p>one the design process is completed and approved, i’ll take the completed, approved designs and turn them into a fully functioning website, built with the siteleaf content management system. siteleaf will allow you to update your website as necessary, easily add in new work, and deploy your site for relatively low cost. included in this part of the process will be a time of training, helping to ease you into the learning curve of a new content management system.</p>

    <h6>final thoughts</h6>
    <p>the goal with this site is to create something that stands out. in any creative sectors, there are many competitors, but the majority of them that i’ve seen have less than stellar portfolio sites. they are too generic, too old, too busy, poorly designed. we will make this portfolio stand out through a number of factors.</p>

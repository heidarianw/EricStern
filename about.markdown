I like to work.

Just ask my friends. My family. My dogs. They’ll concur. Alas, the very fitting domain: ericstern.works.

Right now, I’m working at The Richards Group as a Brand Manager.

That’s me to the left. In a cowboy hat. On the phone. While also posing for a picture. Quite the trifecta in multitasking, if I do say so myself. I have a beard now…

I like telling stories, playing golf, and listening to country music. Click the [🐐](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0LKHF6hMyMdGzxnwgPsTJ2?si=tZVBHhPLRKmsbbMWPuAYkw) for my country playlist. I’ve been told it’s the 🐐.

I also happen to like writing, filmmaking, and telling more stories. Which just so happens to be why you’re here.

Please listen and peruse at your leisure. I’ll be around when you’re done.

Here's to working *(a lot)* together,

I like to work. My friends might say I work a lot, too. Ask my friends. But I only like to produce great work. And that’s the only way to do it. Hence, the name ericstern.works.

But in all seriousness, here’s the rundown. I’m an impassioned storyteller, lifetime golfer, fisherman in the making, and, of course, aspiring adman hailing from the Lone Star State. I got my start in film in 2011, but transitioned to advertising in 2015. My intention is not to leave film behind. Rather, I’m taking all my filmmaking experiences and using them as a foundation for my advertising career.

It’s now 2018, and my films have screened at SXSW, Cannes Court Métrage, The Dallas
International Film Festival, and The Hill Country Film Festival. Having spent the last couple
summers in Dallas, TX working as a freelance producer and designer, I recently interned with
BBH New York and Y&amp;R Austin.

I’m a collaborator, creative problem solver, and someone who takes a personal stake in making
each project I work on great.

So let’s work (a lot) together.

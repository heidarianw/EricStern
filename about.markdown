I like to work.

Just ask my friends. They’ll say I’m always working on the next project.

But in all seriousness, I always strive to produce great work. And that takes a lot of work. Hence the name, ericstern.works.

Here’s the nitty gritty rundown. I’m an impassioned storyteller, lifetime golfer, country music connoisseur, and, of course, aspiring adman hailing from the Lone Star State. I got my start in film in 2011, but transitioned to advertising in 2015. My intention is not to leave film behind. Rather, I’m taking all my filmmaking experiences and using them as a foundation for my advertising career.

Having spent the last couple summers in Dallas working as a freelance producer and designer, I recently interned with BBH New York and Y&R Austin in 2017. It’s now 2018, and I’m a TexasMedia advertising graduate from The University of Texas at Austin. This nationally recognized program provided me with the terrific opportunity of exploring the industry through the planning and strategy lens.

I’m a collaborator, creative problem solver, and someone who takes an innovative approach with all my work. Right now, I'm currently working as a content strategy advocate for the startup, Proclaim Advocates.

So let’s work *(a lot)* together,
